### I love making websites. Pay me to make your website for you!

Web development is very simple and powerful. By hiring me to develop your site, you get a personalized experience that you wouldn't get by going with a large competitor. I speak one-on-one with all of my clients to learn about their business needs, and I carefully design websites around the intentions and goals of the business. 

Here are some of the sites I've created or contributed to that are currently running live:
- [FWKZT.com](https://fwkzt.com)
- [FWKZT.com - Services(Laravel project serving front-end templates)](https://services.fwkzt.com/loading?type=motd)
- [FWKZT.com - API (Laravel back-end API)](https://api.fwkzt.com/servers)
- [Ponder](https://ponder-app.org)

Technologies that I use:
- Laravel
- Laravel Forge
- MySQL/Mariadb
- SQLite
- WordPress
- VueJS
- NodeJS
- Bootstrap CSS
- Tailwind CSS
- PayPal API
- AWS
- Vultr Server Hosting
- Git/GitHub

Progamming Langauges:
- PHP
- HTML/JS/CSS
- Python
- SQL (Structured Query Langauge)
- Shell script

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/visudo20179C/cjk-cv/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
